                                    Jalama Beach is approximately an hour drive from Santa Barbara and a 45-minute drive from Lompoc.  A sign 4.5 miles south of Lompoc off Highway 1 will direct you onto Jalama Road. Follow this scenic 14.5 mile road to the coast. The park entrance will be at the end of the road. Jalama is subject to high winds and rough surf. Lifeguards are on duty during the summer months, however visitors swim at their own risk.

                                    It doesn't take much asking at any of the worlds surf breaks and you'll find someone who is part or has taken part of the Nikonos Project.   We choose to not focus on the best and big names of photography but instead in the fun and adventure to shoot.  Our project may never have a global audience,  and I'm okay with that..  What matters is is that we learn and grow and appreciate what we have
