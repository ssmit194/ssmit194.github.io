                            <h2>Jalama Beach</h2>
                    
                                <p>Land near Jalama Creek was once a Chumash Indian settlement named "Halama". In 1943, 23.5 acres of privately owned land was donated to the County of Santa Barbara from the Atlantic Richfield Oil Company, and thus, our park was formed. Jalama Beach is a respite from typically bustling seaside parks, yet offers many conveniences. Groceries, personal care sundries, firewood, fishing bait and tackle, ice, beer and wine may be purchased at the Jalama Store. Other services include mailing, facsimile, and video rentals. The store and its popular Grill are open daily from 10:00 am.</p>

                                <p>Jalama Beach is approximately an hour drive from Santa Barbara and a 45-minute drive from Lompoc.  A sign 4.5 miles south of Lompoc off Highway 1 will direct you onto Jalama Road. Follow this scenic 14.5 mile road to the coast. The park entrance will be at the end of the road. Jalama is subject to high winds and rough surf. Lifeguards are on duty during the summer months, however visitors swim at their own risk.</p>

                                <p>Day-use picnic areas provide tables and raised fire boxes. Additional activities include surfing, whale-watching, birdwatching, nature photography, and fishing the surf or rock outcroppings for perch, cabezon, kelp, bass, or halibut. Many protected California native plants like sand verbena, saltbush, and sea rocket, grow within park boundaries.</p>
