                	In the era of touchscreens, the method of interacting has changed from a precision pointer to a large pad of a finger. User experience on modern devices can no longer rely on the ease of movement of a pointer on a screen but must consider the physical movement a user must make to interact with a screen. That requires a reorganization of the layout of devices interfaces. Many people today see faults in popular applications and think they can make them better. In one case someone attempted and created a competitor to the native application. Christian Selig, creator of Apollo for Reddit, did was not happy with his experience with the native Reddit application and wanted something more comfortable and familiar. His application, Apollo, is under constant scrutiny and he is updating it to keep his user experience as best as possible.

                	Utilizing heuristic evaluation it can be see that there are moderate and minor issues within the Apollo application. The use of a bottom navigation is present, but the actions are not consistent or clearly marked. Items are labeled using icons and text descriptions, but there is nothing identifying if items have more than one action or what that action might be for new users. There must also take in consideration the limitation of using one evaluator because with this type of evaluation, three evaluators is the minimal requirement so this is not sufficient information on its own and will require other evaluators to reinforce this data.

                	Smart phones and tablets have changed the way we read a screen. Loeffler et al. (2021) tells us that navigation on mobile devices does not follow the conventional western reading style of starting top-left through and to bottom-right, but instead starts at the bottom. The shift from a precision pointer on desktop navigation to a touchscreen/handheld navigation result in a thumb centered motivation in design. The thumb is the primary interaction with screens and tends to only extend so far, and with the common base being located at the bottom of the screen, it is only natural for the most used items to be located there as well. The bottom navigation should stay consistent and be clearly marked with the most used items, and it is important that the user know which item they are located in with some form of feedback from the navigation bar. The change from pointer to thumb as the mode of interaction has changed how we scan screens for most used items and resulted in the prominence of bottom navigation(Loeffler er al.,2021).

                <p>
                	Handheld devices screens do not all have equal real estate. There are certain areas of the screen that are more valuable because a user’s thumb can only reach so far. These considerations would not be as important if a larger percentage of user’s used two hands when interacting with touchscreen devices. Nick Babich (2016) found in research that 49% of user’s rely on one thumb when interacting with handheld devices. People predominantly hold their thumb to the bottom third of their devices, so it is more important to have important interfaces closer to the bottom than it is to the top. User’s will be strained to reach for a commonly used action at the top of a screen, being forced to readjust their hand position to make the action and to return from the action. Even when designing for user’s who prefer two handed interaction, designers must take into account that two hands are not always available for interaction.(Babich, 2016)

                <p>
                	Bottom navigation is becoming more than a trend, it is a requirement for modern handheld devices. The transitions of precision pointer to an inaccurate thumb, conventional western reading to a bottom-up scanning, and the limitations of the reach of users all help create the trend of bottom navigation. It is rare to see applications that do not utilize bottom navigation, but there are still some that hold onto the past with navigation items in the upper parts of the screen. This change is distinguishing handheld devices from desktop devices and the experiences users have when interacting with each. This will challenge designers when trying to be consistent over different interfaces. There will soon be changes in what is the standard of mobile application design.
